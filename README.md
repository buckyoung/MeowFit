MeowFit
=======

The MeowFit is an Arduino-based, robotic laser-pointer built to get lazy cats moving. 

You can view the project at [BuckYoung.com](http://buckyoung.com/portfolio/meowfit/).

Featured here is the Arduino's .ino file which constitutes the AI behind the laser-pointer (I have saved it as a C file for better syntax highlighting within github). I have attempted to make the code easy to read and edit for personal use.

The AI is designed to be interesting and get the most movement out of even the laziest cats!

Feel free to use this code in any of your projects.
